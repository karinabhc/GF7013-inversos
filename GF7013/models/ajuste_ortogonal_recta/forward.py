"""
Defines a class that implements the forward model for the 
orthogonal straight line fit. As this problem is nonlinear, returns the misfit vector 
corresponding to the distance between observations and straight line divided by the 
standard deviation of such distance.

A forward model class must implement the method .eval(m) that returns the forward
calculation of model m.
